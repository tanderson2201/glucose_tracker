# Glucose Tracker

![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen)

Glucose Tracker is a Python application that allows glucose readings from LibreLinkUp to be displayed on your desktop screen. The purpose of the application is to provide a more efficient way to monitor your glucose levels compared to the official LibreLink/LibreLinkUp application by displaying the glucose reading on your screen, allowing you to set the refresh interval, and enabling you to easily see the trend of your glucose levels. More details about this project can be found [here](https://tanderson.net/posts/LibreLink-Tracker-Project/).

### Features:

- Always visible glucose display.
- Set glucose reading refresh interval.
- Refresh button to get the latest reading (or if the connection is lost).
- Error notifications if glucose readings cannot be displayed.
- Color-coded glucose levels: 
  - **Red**: Out of range
  - **Orange**: Slightly out of range
  - **Green**: Within range
- Trend indicator for glucose levels: 
  - Dropping Fast
  - Going Low
  - Stable
  - Going High
  - Increasing Fast
